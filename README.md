# Smart Home Security System with OpenCV
Utilizing OpenCV's capabilities, a security system was made where the user, from the React-based GUI, can opt to arm or disarm the system. If the system is armed, it will continuously be on the lookout for any humans that enter into the camera's field of view. Upon disarming the system, all motion detected during the armed phase will appear on the GUI for the user to playback and see what occurred during those moments. Additionally, when motion is detected, the user will get an SMS indicating that the system detected motion and the message will include the time as well. The messaging feature was done through the use of Twilio and the recordings were stored on Google Cloud.
